# KALAKRITI AI: Poster Generator using Hugging Face API

Welcome to our Hackathon project repository! Our project is a Poster Generator that utilizes the Hugging Face API to generate images, and then allows users to add customizable text onto these images.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for generating visually appealing posters. With the power of the Hugging Face API, users can create posters with diverse styles and themes. The flexibility to add custom text enables users to tailor the posters according to their specific needs, whether it's for advertising, events, or any other purpose. The frontend of the project is made completly using streamlit as it was really easy to use and quick to implement with the given time constraint

## Important Notes

- **Hugging Face API Key**: In the `1_👩‍💻_App` file, please ensure to replace the placeholder on line 57 with your own Hugging Face API key. This key is necessary for accessing the API and generating images.
- **CSV File Path**: On line 53 of the `1_👩‍💻_App` file, you'll find a placeholder for the path of the `enhancements.csv` file. This file contains data for enhancing the generated images and is already included in the repository. Please update this path accordingly if it has been moved within the project structure.
